## About the Project

The project is a simple grade calculator with a complex UI architecture. The project is built using the React Js Library to showcase my skills in React and web application development. The Web App is made for college students in mind to track their grades and progress. The project has two modes of presenting the user's data.

### Overview Mode

Overview mode is used to display the user's overall subject data in a table format. The data is organized by a layer of filters, `years` and `sems`, to organize the subjects similar to the student's college education structure.

### Subject Mode _`[In Progress]`_

Subject mode is a detailed view of the user's subject data. It displays the user's assessment in a particular subject. The view divides the data into categories, representing the types of assessments there are in each subject (ex. Summative, Enabling, Formative, etc.)

## Project Reflection

This project took a while and a lot of revisions to make, nonetheless it was fun working on this and greatly helped me improve my basic foundation in React js. One of the few difficulties I've faced while working on this project was working with the UI and UX. While I may be working on as a Frontend developer, I don't think highly of my skills in UI and UX design with my current experience. As such I was having difficulties deciding the best and most efficient design for user friendliness. There were instances during development where I had to reconsider a number of my UI designs since it did not fully match the overall goal of the app thus leading me to refactor a lot of the app's logic.

This difficulty lead me to consider learning some code design principles as to minimize the number of times I may need to refactor everytime a new modification or feature is introduced to a project. This also helped me become a step closer to creating production ready code by keeping in mind some best practices when programming. In the future, I plan to consider and experiment with development workflow as to minimize any difficulties I may face during development. I also plan to develop my skills in designing to increase my skills in fronend development.
