## About the Project

The project is a simple grade calculator built with React to showcase my skills as a React developer. The Web App is made for college students in mind to track their grades and progress as they continue their studies. Besides calculating grades, it is also capable of managing the user's studies by warning and inforimg the user if there are any fields that require their attention if they wish to attain a specific grade (which can be set within the web app's settings). More information of each secific features will be explained bellow.

### 1. Grade Calculation and Prediction

The basic function of this project is to compute the user's grades flexibly. The program is able to compute the user's grade in each term, course, semester or even school year. Besides this, the user can also predict their future grades by allowing them to input dummy grades to view the potential grades.
`This feature is not enabled by default but can easily be accessed by toggling the prediciton mode within the grade settings in each table.`

### 2. Target Grades

Besides computing and storing grades, the users can also set their target grades for each subject, semester or school year. This featue is optional if they wish to have the web app inform them if they have courses that need their attention. When this feature is enabled, it'll automatically compute if the user's current grade meets their target grade and if not, the program will inform them on areas that needs their effort if they wish to reach their target grade.
